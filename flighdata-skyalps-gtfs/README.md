## General information: ##

General instructions can be found at the [Open Data Hub elaborations README](../README.md).

The instructions in the following paper will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

## History: ##

SkyAlps is an Italian airline operator managing flights at the Bolzano airport in South Tyrol. Thanks to the support of NOI, SkyAlps has initiated an innovation process that aims to share the data of the air services offered. The function requested by the GTFS is to map the available data provided through the web services of the Open Data Hub (https://mobility.api.opendatahub.bz.it/v2/flat,node/Flight) into the GTFS format specification, which foresees data to be stored in a certain number of TXT files, as summarized in the Specification file.
The agency, calendar, calendar_dates, fare_attributes, fare_rules, feed_into, frequencies, routes, shapes, stop_times, stops, transfers, and trips gtfs files are written directly from the information retrieved by the ODH API JSON. The following converter is organized into several components: 
[- Rest Template,](java/it/noitechpark/rest/FlightRest.java)
[- Dto,](java/it/noitechpark/dto)
[- Constants Classes,](java/it/noitechpark/contastsclasses)
[- Services,](java/it/noitechpark/service)
[- Enum,](java/it/noitechpark/enumClasses)

The following Converter has been designed to assist transit agency to transform existing route information from three data sources.

When you will run the converter a GTFS folder with the current timestamp attached to it will be created in the home directory of the current logged in user (See the [GTFSFolder](java/it/noitechpark/service/GTFSFolder) class (lines 15-17) for this part of the code).
In this folder you will have the .txt files filled as per request (to view the logic keep reading below or you can refer both to the [it.noitechpar.service](java/it/noitechpark/service) package classes and the [it.noitechpark package SkyApplication.java](java/it/noitechpark/SkyAlpsApplication.java) class between lines 87-258).

## GTFS Components: ##

[- Rest Template: ](java/it/noitechpark/rest/FlightRest.java)

This class is designed to make a call on the ODH API and retrieve the JSON resource template. 

[- Dto Classes: ](java/it/noitechpark/dto)

These classes represent the data that will be posted by the rest template output. This class contains also model classes for each of the specified .txt files. 
Each variable of the DTO Model Classes has been assigned the same type declared on the specification file. 

[- Constants Classes: ](java/it/noitechpark/contastsclasses)

This class defines the filenames and file fields used in the .txt files.

[- GTFS Services: ](java/it/noitechpark/service)

This section defines the GTFS output file path, and it is responsible for creating, checking, and filling each file. 

[- Enum Classes: ](java/it/noitechpark/enumClasses)
This class contains a group of constants handled by the service classes and appropriately used for each file that requires the mas for specifications. 


## GTFS Service Classes: ##

[GTFSFolder](java/it/noitechpark/service/GTFSFolder)

This class generates a GTFS folder inside the current user's Desktop folder. 
 The GTFS folder will be appended with the current Date. Appropriate checks to check if the folder already exists are performed.

[GTFSFile](java/it/noitechpark/service/GTFSFile)

This class is responsible for creating the GTFS .txt files inside the folder previously created. 

[GTFSReadFileFolder](java/it/noitechpark/service/GTFSReadFileFolder)

This class retrieves the files previously created and returns them after checking that they exist. 

[GTFSWrite](java/it/noitechpark/service/GTFSWrite)

These classes write inside the .txt files and the section defines the transit files.txt input values defined by the specifications. See below for more details. Each .txt file has been written after checks are performed on each of them.

[GTFSCsvFile](java/it/noitechpark/service/GTFSCsvFile)

This class is responsible to get the CSV file needed to fill the fields stop_lat and stop_lon of the Stops.txt file. This class also check if the files is present or not, and if it is not present then it downloads it automatically.

[GTFSCheck Classes: ](java/it/noitechpark/service)

These classes check through all the conditional requirements for each of the GTFS files before they are written: 
- [GTFSCheckAgency](java/it/noitechpark/service/GTFSCheckAgency): it checks the mandatory fields.
- [GTFSCheckCalendar](java/it/noitechpark/service/GTFSCheckCalendar): it checks the mandatory fields. 
- [GTFSCheckCalendarDates](java/it/noitechpark/service/GTFSCheckCalendarDates): it checks the mandatory fields. 
- [GTFSCheckRoutes](java/it/noitechpark/service/GTFSCheckRoutes): it checks the mandatory fields and whether or not the agency_id field is mandatory or optional based on a conditional requirement that the agency.txt field contains more than a record. It also checks that either one between the short_name or long_name fields is present.
- [GTFSCheckStops](java/it/noitechpark/service/GTFSCheckStops): It checks the value of the location_type field and based on that defines whether or not the agency_id, stop_lon, and stop_lat fields might be mandatory or optional.
- [GTFSCheckStopsTimes](java/it/noitechpark/service/GTFSCheckStopsTimes): It checks the mandatory fields and whether or not the field Timepoint has a value of 1 or not. Based on the Timepoint field value it establishes if arrival_time and departure_time fields can be optional or mandatory. 
- [GTFSCheckTrips](java/it/noitechpark/service/GTFSCheckTrips): It checks the mandatory fields and whether or not inside the file Trips.txt the record has a pickup/drop-off behavior set as “continuous” and establishes if the shape_id field might be optional or mandatory. 



## GTFS Service Classes Specifications: ##
